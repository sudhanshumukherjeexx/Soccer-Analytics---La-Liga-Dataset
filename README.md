# Soccer-Analytics---La-Liga-Dataset
This repository is dedicated to Soccer Analytics project based on La Liga Dataset from  2015 - 2021 for training the model and 2022-2023 dataset for testing the model.  I have used to PyTorch for building my Deep Learning model which can predict Wins, Loss and Draws based on features used to train the model.
